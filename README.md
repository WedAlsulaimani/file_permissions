# file_permissions

There are three categories for the permissions: owners, groups and others.

each category have three permissions, read(r) = 4 , write(w) = 2 and execute(x) = 1. the total of these three permission = 7
the total number for the three categories and their permissions = 777

I created a python file using touch command, then I changed the permissions to be  "rwxrwxr-x"
